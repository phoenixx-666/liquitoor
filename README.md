This is a Team Card generator for [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net) based on [Toornament](https://toornament.com) pages.

Runs with the [Run Javascript](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/run-javascript/lmilalhkkdhfieeienjbiicclobibjao) extension for Chrome or with the [javascript](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/javascript/) extension for Firefox.

Just open the Toornament website and copy the contents of `liquitoor.js` file into the extension window and then make the code execute every time a Toornament page is loaded.

To get the Team Cards, go to the "Participants" page of any tournament and press the "Show Players" button, created by the plugin. It will show you the players and generate the Team Cards wiki code.
